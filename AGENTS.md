# ZombieSim Agent Guide

ZombieSim is an installed Garry's Mod gamemode. It combines realm-specific Lua gameplay code with a PowerShell pipeline that generates and compiles reusable Source VMF recipe maps.

## Active Task Tracker

- `todo-alpha-2.7.md` is the authoritative tracker for current Alpha 2.7 work.
- `docs/todo-alpha-2.6.md`, older roadmaps, test logs, and prior agent notes are historical context unless an item is explicitly promoted into the active tracker.
- When the active milestone changes, update this guide and the root tracker together; do not infer current work from historical phase labels.

## Read First

- [readme.md](readme.md) contains the supported build, staging, in-game, and Walker simulator command sequences.
- [docs.md](docs.md) is the generator reference, including profile behavior, authored tile orientation, Hammer checks, and compile diagnostics.
- [docs/gdd.md](docs/gdd.md) describes intended gameplay behavior. Consult it before changing player progression or survival systems.
- [generator-settings.json](generator-settings.json) is the authoritative configuration schema. Do not infer settings or output paths from filenames.
- [docs/two_by_two_tile_templates_plan.md](docs/two_by_two_tile_templates_plan.md) describes multi-tile template work.
- `bin/walker-simulator` is the portable C++ walker project; it stays isolated from Lua and generated assets, and its behavior and commands are documented in the root README.

## Runtime Architecture

- Keep Lua realm boundaries explicit: `init.lua` and `sv_*.lua` are server-side, `cl_*.lua` is client-side, and `shared.lua` / `sh_*.lua` run in both realms. Send shared and client files with `AddCSLuaFile`, then `include` files that must execute on the server.
- Preserve the existing Lua style: `//` comments, spaced function calls, four-space indentation in server files, and tabs where an existing shared/client file already uses tabs.
- World data is accessed through `ZM_World`; safe-zone lookup is owned by `ZM_SafeZones`. Use their APIs rather than duplicating coordinate, map-path, or profile resolution logic.
- Register network strings on the server before sending. Keep player persistence server-only through the SQL helpers and retain profile scoping.
- Treat raw grid coordinates as diagnostics only. Display and manipulate logical world coordinates through `ZM_World`; for a cross-map change, verify persisted `CellX`/`CellY`, safe-zone id, and resolved map path with `zombiesim_player_status` after the destination loads.
- Before changing a request involving a “map,” identify the intended surface: the world-map window, HUD minimap, satellite/level view, or Garry's Mod level transition. Locate its owning module and input binding; ask a focused question when the request does not distinguish them.
- Before adding client-side GLua or Derma calls, confirm the API signature from a compatible local call site or current Garry's Mod documentation. Validate new client scripts for syntax and exercise prompt first-run, decline/reset, and reopening paths.

## Generator And Asset Boundaries

- Hand-authored tile VMFs live in `tiletemplates`; base maps, launcher VMFs (`celltemplates/launchers`), and standalone safe rooms live in `celltemplates`. Edit these source assets, not generated files in `generated/src*`.
- `content/` is distributable addon content only. Keep compiler logs/reports/intermediate BSPs and other developer outputs under `generated/`; launcher compiler output belongs in `generated/launcher_build`, while required packaged BSPs/materials remain under `content/`.
- Treat generated manifests, plans, VMFs, BSPs, staged profile maps, runtime JSON, and map materials as pipeline outputs. Regenerate them with the matching profile rather than hand-editing them.
- Every generator script must resolve settings through `bin/resolve_world_generation_profile.ps1`. Use `-WorldProfile preview` for normal iteration; it is isolated from the production `city` profile.
- Preserve canonical rotations and carpark endcap rules. `bin/carpark_endcaps.psm1` owns carpark cap selection and yaw; do not duplicate or derive it from lane role. Confirm orientation changes in Hammer.
- Before changing a placement or yaw mapping, inspect the canonical authored orientation and the exact generated `func_instance` that fails. Validate all four cardinal outputs plus any affected exceptional recipe in the developer zoo; never apply a global yaw offset from a single screenshot or recipe.
- For a visual placement report, identify the selected instance and express the intended relationship in logical tile coordinates and cardinal directions. If the screenshot does not establish whether a piece should be edge-adjacent or in-line/in-front, ask one focused clarification before changing placement logic.
- Before diagnosing or validating a generated layout, resolve its exact recipe filename from the current matching plan, rebuild that recipe from current inputs, and confirm the inspected VMF's instance name, source template, origin, and angles. Do not infer freshness or behavior from a similarly named recipe or an older zoo output.
- Do not change a native model's `ModelOffset` to correct Backrooms placement. Correct the generator's block-cell placement.
- Standalone safe-zone maps are complete templates copied unchanged. Edit `celltemplates/safezones`, not their generated copies.

## Focused Validation

Run PowerShell commands from the repository root. For changes to planning or VMF generation, use the preview pipeline and start with the fast structural check:

```powershell
.\bin\generate_world_cells.ps1 -WorldProfile preview -Seed 1337
.\bin\plan_cell_templates.ps1 -WorldProfile preview -MapData .\bin\preview_grid_24x24_seed_1337.json
.\bin\build_cell_vmfs.ps1 -WorldProfile preview -PlanData .\bin\preview_grid_24x24_seed_1337_template_plan.json -RefreshGenerated -PruneStaleGenerated
.\bin\build_city.ps1 -WorldProfile preview -VBSPOnly -OnlyRequiredMaps -CleanStagedCity
```

- After structural tile changes, run `./bin/check_vis_budgets.ps1 -WorldProfile preview -RefreshPortalData`; inspect affected layouts in Hammer, including generated developer zoos when applicable.
- For planner yaw changes, extend and run focused regressions for the reported recipe and previously correct affected cases before broad regeneration. Building frontage changes must pass `./bin/test_building_frontage.ps1` and `./bin/test_multi_tile_templates.ps1` before refreshing the preview plan and VMFs.
- Only use `-SkipVBSP` with `-SkipRecipeRefresh` when the source VMFs are unchanged from the portal preflight. Review `generated/build_<profile>/compile-report.json` for failed or incomplete stages.
- A full VVIS/VRAD build and in-game launch are deliberate final checks. Batch related changes before launching Garry's Mod; reload `zn_preview_start` after preview staging or `zn_city_start` after city staging.
- For `cl_*.lua`, camera, Derma, and map-transition changes, parsing or compilation is only static validation. Do not report behavior as verified until the affected input path has been exercised in a running client; otherwise state that an in-game check remains.

## Environment Notes

- The repository is already under Garry's Mod. The active compiler profile resolves `vbsp`, `vvis`, and `vrad` from the game's `bin` directory.
- The development command bridge source is `content/data_static/consolecommands.txt`; its acknowledgement is deliberately written outside the repository to Garry's Mod `DATA` at `data/zombiesim/consolecommands.result.json`.
- For cross-map command automation or `buildcubemaps`, first run a one-command in-engine capability probe and verify its bridge acknowledgement. Confirm permissions and persistence before implementing a sequencer; retain a single-step manual command fallback.
- Scripts use `Set-StrictMode` and `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`. Retain parameter validation, path construction via `Join-Path`, and profile-driven paths. In Windows PowerShell 5.1, use `System.Diagnostics.Process` for monitored compiler processes because `Start-Process -PassThru` can expose an empty `ExitCode`.
